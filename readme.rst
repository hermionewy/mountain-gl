Mountain GL
===========

A learning project for 3D WebGL
-------------------------------

This project loads an image file, uses it to generate a landscape, and then lights and animates that landscape using WebGL. ``script.js`` is heavily-commented, and is the best place to start. It also uses `GLMatrix <http://glmatrix.net/>`_ for vector and matrix math, and does not spend very much time explaining how the 3D math itself works. I recommend `Web GL Fundamentals <http://webglfundamentals.com>`_ if you want to learn that part of building a 3D scene in WebGL, since it walks through both the API and the math involved. This project is meant to be a little bit lower-level, with less magic, than that tutorial is.
